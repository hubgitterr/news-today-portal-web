            <div><h2>Businesses in bloom sets record for new business creation</h2>
            <p>Businesses grew 40% last year in comparison with 2020, with more than 178,000 new entrepreneurs in the state. That number outpaced every other year on record. Smith started her business in 2018 after she couldn't find someone to preserve her wedding bouquet. So she took on the project herself. Now, she creates one-of-a-kind picture frames for her clients. She says she loves owning a business, even though it requires her to wear many hats. She makes up a growing list of entrepreneurs in the world, as more people register new businesses. In 2021, the statistics company surveyed new businesses created one, two and three years ago. It found that 90% of those businesses are still in operation and that more new business creators were minority-owned, women-owned and a younger age.</p></div>

            <div><h2>Family calling for changes to crosswalk in our city</h2>
            <p>Ray, who is the pastor of Assembly of Faith Church in Dallas, North Carolina, was severely injured and his family says he almost died. But Ray defied all odds and survived. One year later, he’s still not home. He’s currently in a rehabilitation center in Winston-Salem. Ray has been a pastor for 45 years. Ray hasn’t been able to return to his church since the incident. Petty says the family has come together to run the church in his absence. They had a lot of supporters rallying in front of the crosswalk last week, calling on officials to make the crosswalk safer. Midgett says they want to see more signs with LED lights, so it’s more visible both during the day and night, when Ray was hit. The family says they see many people speed through the area and they know that other people have been hit near this crosswalk.</p></div>

            <div><h2>UNC-Chapel Hill will host new hub for research into how technology impacts child brain development</h2>
            <p>A team of professors said there is a direct connection between how much times teenagers are on their phones and how well they can engage someone their age in person. Dr. Eva Telzer, a UNC associate professor of psychology and neuroscience, said a teenager constantly checking the phone relates to long-term changes in brain development. “We hope that we can start to show the science about how important it is for the way that adolescents’ brains are being shaped,” Telzer said. All of the data came from students volunteering information during an on-campus course called PSYC 180: Social Media, Technology, and the Adolescent Brain. Dr. Mitch Prinstein, professor of psychology and neuroscience, said the information was gathered over four semesters from 800 students.</p></div>

            <div><h2>Allergy season is arriving sooner</h2>
            <p>Scientists say allergy season is starting sooner and lasting longer because of climate change. Allergists said at one time, pollen season didn’t kick off until St. Patrick’s Day. Now higher pollen counts can start as early as Valentine's Day. According to a study from the journal Me and Nature, as the world becomes warmer, allergy season will start weeks sooner and end many days later. Springtime in general gives some people job stability. Once mid-March hits, Joe Wright said this is a busy time of year for landscaping. Climate scientists said a warmer world directly ties to an earlier and longer allergy season. In another study published in the Journal of Sciences in 2020, human-caused climate change could impact respiratory health because of higher concentrations of airborne pollen. Wright said he has been in a landscaping job for 10 years. He said no matter the impact on his own health, for him it will be business as usual like this time every March.</p></div>
